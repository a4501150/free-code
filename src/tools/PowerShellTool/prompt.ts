   - Ternary (\`?:\`), null-coalescing (\`??\`), and null-conditional (\`?.\`) operators are NOT available. Use \`if/else\` and explicit \`$null -eq\` checks instead.
   - Avoid \`2>&1\` on native executables. In 5.1, redirecting a native command's stderr inside PowerShell wraps each line in an ErrorRecord (NativeCommandError) and sets \`$?\` to \`$false\` even when the exe returned exit code 0. stderr is already captured for you — do not redirect it.
   - Default file encoding is UTF-16 LE (with BOM). When writing files other tools will read, pass \`-Encoding utf8\` to \`Out-File\`/\`Set-Content\`.

  return `Executes a given PowerShell command and returns its output. Working directory persists between commands; shell state (variables, functions) does not.

The user reads every tool result in the session, and output is auto-saved to a file (referenced in the result) when it grows — run the command without a pipe: a pipe through \`Select-Object\` or \`Select-String\` truncates what the user gets to see.

${getEditionSection(edition)}

PowerShell Syntax Notes:
   - Variables use $ prefix: $myVar = "value"
   - Escape character is backtick (\`), not backslash
   - Use Verb-Noun cmdlet naming: Get-ChildItem, Set-Location, New-Item, Remove-Item
   - Common aliases: ls (Get-ChildItem), cd (Set-Location), cat (Get-Content), rm (Remove-Item)
   - Pipe operator | works similarly to bash but passes objects, not text
   - Use Select-Object, Where-Object, ForEach-Object for filtering and transformation
   - String interpolation: "Hello $name" or "Hello $($obj.Property)"
   - Registry access uses PSDrive prefixes: \`HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\...\`, \`HKCU:\\...\` — NOT raw \`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\...\`
   - Environment variables: read with \`$env:NAME\`, set with \`$env:NAME = "value"\` (NOT \`Set-Variable\` or bash \`export\`)
   - Call native exe with spaces in path via call operator: \`& "C:\\Program Files\\App\\app.exe" arg1 arg2\`

Interactive and blocking commands (these wait for input — this tool runs with -NonInteractive):
   - NEVER use \`Read-Host\`, \`Get-Credential\`, \`Out-GridView\`, \`$Host.UI.PromptForChoice\`, or \`pause\`
   - Destructive cmdlets (\`Remove-Item\`, \`Stop-Process\`, \`Clear-Content\`, and similar) can prompt for confirmation. Add \`-Confirm:$false\` when you intend the action to proceed. Use \`-Force\` for read-only/hidden items.
   - Never use \`git rebase -i\`, \`git add -i\`, or other commands that open an interactive editor

Passing multiline strings (commit messages, file content) to native executables:
   - Use a single-quoted here-string so PowerShell does not expand \`$\` or backticks inside. The closing \`'@\` MUST be at column 0 (no leading whitespace) on its own line — indenting it is a parse error:
<example>
git commit -m @'
Commit message here.
Second line with $literal dollar signs.
'@
</example>
   - Use \`@'...'@\` (single-quoted, literal) not \`@"..."@\` (double-quoted, interpolated) unless you need variable expansion
   - For arguments containing \`-\`, \`@\`, or other characters PowerShell parses as operators, use the stop-parsing token: \`git log --% --format=%H\`

Usage notes:
   - Timeout in milliseconds, up to ${getMaxTimeoutMs()}ms; default ${getDefaultTimeoutMs()}ms.
   - Output over ${getMaxOutputLength()} characters is truncated before being returned to you.${backgroundNote ? '\n' + backgroundNote : ''}
   - Prefer the dedicated tools over PowerShell for file operations: ${GLOB_TOOL_NAME} for file search, ${GREP_TOOL_NAME} for content search, ${FILE_READ_TOOL_NAME} to read, ${FILE_EDIT_TOOL_NAME} to edit, ${FILE_WRITE_TOOL_NAME} to write.
   - When issuing multiple commands:
   - Independent commands: make multiple ${POWERSHELL_TOOL_NAME} tool calls in a single message.
   - Dependent commands: chain them in a single ${POWERSHELL_TOOL_NAME} call (see edition-specific chaining syntax above).
   - \`;\` runs commands sequentially regardless of earlier failure. DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are allowed in quoted strings and here-strings).
   - Do NOT prefix commands with \`cd\` or \`Set-Location\` — the working directory is already set to the correct project directory automatically.`
