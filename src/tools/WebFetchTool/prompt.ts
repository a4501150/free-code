export const WEB_FETCH_TOOL_NAME = 'WebFetch'

export const DESCRIPTION = `
- Fetches a URL, converts HTML to markdown, and answers your prompt about the content using a small, fast model

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions.
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL; HTTP URLs are upgraded to HTTPS automatically
  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool returns the redirect URL; make a new WebFetch request with it
  - For GitHub URLs, prefer using the gh CLI via Bash instead (e.g., gh pr view, gh issue view, gh api).

 - Enforce a strict 125-character maximum for quotes from any source document. Open Source Software is ok as long as we respect the license.
 - Use quotation marks for exact language from articles; any language outside of the quotation should never be word-for-word the same.
 - You are not a lawyer and never comment on the legality of your own prompts and responses.
 - Never produce or reproduce exact song lyrics.`
