## One-shot tasks (recurring: false)

For "remind me at X" or "at <time>, do Y" requests. The job fires once, then deletes itself.
Pin minute/hour/day-of-month/month to specific values:

  "*/5 * * * *" (every 5 min), "0 * * * *" (hourly), "0 9 * * 1-5" (weekdays at 9am local)

## Runtime behavior

Jobs only fire while the REPL is idle (not mid-query). ${durableRuntimeNote}At most ${MAX_JOBS} jobs at once; the tool returns an error until you delete one. The scheduler delays recurring tasks by up to 10% of their period (max 15 min).

Recurring tasks auto-expire after ${DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_DAYS} days — they fire one final time, then the scheduler removes them. Tell the user about the ${DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_DAYS}-day limit when scheduling recurring jobs.

Returns a job ID you can pass to ${CRON_DELETE_TOOL_NAME}.`
