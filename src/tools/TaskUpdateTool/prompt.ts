export const PROMPT = `Use this tool to update a task in the task list.

## When to Use This Tool

**Mark tasks as resolved:**
- When you have completed the work described in a task
- When a task is no longer needed or has been superseded
- IMPORTANT: Always mark your assigned tasks as resolved when you finish them
- After resolving, call TaskList to find your next task

- ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
- If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
- When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
- Never mark a task as completed if:
  - Tests are failing
  - Implementation is partial
  - You encountered unresolved errors
  - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

**Delete tasks:**
- When a task is no longer relevant or was created in error
- Setting status to \`deleted\` permanently removes the task

**Update task details:**
- When requirements change or become clearer
- When establishing dependencies between tasks

## Status Workflow

Status progresses: \`pending\` → \`in_progress\` → \`completed\`

Use \`deleted\` to permanently remove a task.

## Staleness

Make sure to read a task's latest state using \`TaskGet\` before updating it.

## Examples

Mark task as in progress when starting work:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "status": "in_progress"}
\`\`\`

Mark task as completed after finishing work:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "status": "completed"}
\`\`\`

Delete a task:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "status": "deleted"}
\`\`\`

Claim a task by setting owner:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "owner": "my-name"}
\`\`\`

Set up task dependencies:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "2", "addBlockedBy": ["1"]}
\`\`\`
